        <!-- RNN Text Classification Project -->
        <section class="project-box left">
          <h2>RNN Text Classification</h2>
          <p>This project is a Flask application hosting a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented with TensorFlow.
             Its main functionality lies in sentiment analysis, allowing users to input text for classification.
              What sets it apart is the capability to analyze sentiments in bulk from YouTube comments using the YouTube API.
               Developed as my third-year project at Toi Ohomai, this straightforward yet effective solution showcases practical skills in machine learning and web development,
                making it a noteworthy addition to my portfolio.</p>

                <h3>Small Summary</h3>
                <p>I am a passionate software developer with a focus on creating innovative solutions and enhancing user experiences.
                   My journey in the field of information technology began at Toi Ohomai Institute, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Applied Information Technology.
                    During my time at Toi Ohomai, I created several C# GUI applications and more than a dozen models in TensorFlow.
                     I also studied client-server web development and much more.
                      My skills are mostly related to C# and .Net, but I have dabbled in C++, Python, and several web technologies like React, JavaScript, and the full MERN stack.</p>
